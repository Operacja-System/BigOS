Versioning
==========

All version numbers in BigOS follow the `Major.Minor.Patch` format.

* **Major** – Increment this when changes are made to existing interfaces that break backward compatibility.

* **Minor** – Increment this when additions or backward-compatible changes are made to the interface.

* **Patch** – Increment this for bug fixes or other non-breaking corrections.
