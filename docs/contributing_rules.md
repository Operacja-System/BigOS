## Formatting

Ensure your code is properly formatted before submitting a pull request (use `scripts/format.sh`).  

## Naming conventions

- Use `snake_case` for names (including file names).
- Use `_t` at the end of typedef definitions.
- Use `ALL_CAPS` for MACROS.
- Use `ALL_CAPS` for enum values and include the name of the enum at the beginning of the value name.
- Prefix global variables with `g_`.

### Naming rules

- Don't use magic numbers, use #define or const variables to name them (within reason).  
- Don't use acronyms others then the ones specified [here](acronyms.md).  

## Comments

- If using comment labels please write them like this:
    - `//TODO:`
    - `//NOTE:`
    - `//WARNING:`
    - `//BUG:`
    - `//PERF:` – for marking code that needs optimization
    - `//FIX:` – for marking code that needs fixing
    - `//HACK:` – for marking a temporary solution that needs redoing
    - `//TEST:` – for marking code used for testing
- Use Doxygen-style comments for functions and structs.  
  **Update comments when modifying code!**

> The colon after labeled comments is important for `TODO`-searching scripts
